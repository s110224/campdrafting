What is Campdrafting? 





Campdrafting has its origins with the pioneering stockmen of the Australian bush. It is believed to have begun in outback Queensland, with stockmen having informal competitions for entertainment.

As with American rodeo events, such as cutting, working cow horse and team penning it is obvious that all these events, including Campdrafting, are based on the skills required to work with cattle.

When droving or mustering thousands of head of cattle on the open plains of the Australian outback, the stockmen would need to ‘cut out’ a beast from the mob (herd). The beast may need to be castrated or branded, so to remove it the stockman had to block it from returning to the herd. The beast could then be moved to a holding yard or thrown to the ground where the procedure was performed 




The sport of Campdrafting 



The sport of Campdrafting was eventually developed as a way of proving the skills of the horse and rider. This earned them respect amongst their peers, as well as increasing the value of their horse. The first formal Campdrafting competition was held at the Tenterfield Show in 1885. Competing at this event was Clarence Smith, a cattleman and horse breeder. Clarence Smith went on to create the rules and judging procedures for the sport, which haven’t changed much since.

In a Campdrafting competition, a mounted rider moves into a small yard and selects one beast from a small mob of cattle. He or she then proceeds to move the beast towards the camp opening, which is blocked by two gates with men holding them shut. The mounted rider blocks and turns the beast several times across the face of the camp to demonstrate the horse’s ability to hold the beast away from the mob. When the rider feels that they have shown the judge enough he or she calls for the gates to be opened and they move out into a larger arena to complete the course (the run).

The course consists of two pegs set apart, one on the left and one on the right directly out from the camp gate. Some distance from these pegs are another two pegs that are set close together and represent the gate. The judge declares at the beginning of competition whether the course is left hand or right hand. If the course is right hand the rider must complete a circle around the right hand peg first, then changeover in the middle and complete a circle around the left hand peg. The rider then drives the beast out behind the gate and pushes it through the gate. At this point, the rider has finished the ‘run’, which must be completed in less than 40 seconds.

The score is out of 100 points. This cut out is worth a maximum of 26 points, the ‘run’ a maximum of four points and a further possible 70 points for ‘horsework’. A good Campdrafter is not just a fine horseman, but also needs cattle skills to select a beast that will run well.
